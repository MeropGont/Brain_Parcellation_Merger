# Brain_Parcellation_Merger
This repository contains a MATLAB pipeline for merging the Lausanne2018 parcellation (with over 1000 cortical nodes) and the cerebellar parcellation from the CERES pipeline (26 lobule volumes) into a unified brain atlas. The script ensures robust label handling, prevents region overlap, and logs the merging process for quality control.
